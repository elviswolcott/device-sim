# Usage #

Download [Overwolf](https://download.overwolf.com/install/Download?Channel=Developers).

Clone the repository.

In Overwolf, go to `Settings>Support>Development options`

`Load unpacked extension...` and find the location you cloned the repository.

When you launch the extension you will see a simple window with options.

`New Device +` can be used to create up to 5 devices (borderless windows).

At first, nothing will appear. You can customize the `width` and `height` or choose one of the device presets. Enter a url in the `Navigate` bar and click `go` to open it in the window.

Hovering the top of these windows will reveal a bar that can be used to drag them around.

The controls window can be minimized at any time. Closing it will close the entire app.
